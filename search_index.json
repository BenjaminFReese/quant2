Think of this site as a log of all of the topics we cover in class and in lab sessions. I will make updates throughout the semester as we cover more advanced material. I hope this proves to be a helpful and beneficial resource and offer an easier to access format than the Google Doc. Let me know if any of this code doesn’t run correctly or if you have any questions or issues!

This is a classic case of omitted variable bias, however. Once we control for the percent vaxed in an area, the trump2020_percent loses statistical significance. We can see in the second model that the coefficient on the Trump vote share variable greatly decreases and is no longer statistically significant at conventional thresholds. vaxed_pct is statistically significant at the \\(p&lt;.05\\) level and indicates that a one percent increase in an areas vaccination rate corresponds, on average, with a 1.9 decrease in deaths per capita, holding trump2020_percent constant. This result stands even when controlling for an areas density as shown in model 3. 2.4 Assess specific vaccines Create and add vaccinated percent by state for each of the Pfizer, Modern and Janssen (which is Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. Use pop2019 for population Use Series_Complete_Moderna_18Plus, Series_Complete_Janssen_18Plus and Series_Complete_Pfizer_18Plus for the vaccination totals. Estimate a model in which deaths per capita is a function of all three vaccination rates. Explain what the results mean, especially in light of the results above for overall vaccination results. Explain how one would compare the efficacy of the individual vaccines (e.g., whether the Moderna vaccine works better than the Johnson and Johnson vaccine). Many answers would work here. ## Creating vaxed percent variables for different vaccines df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(vaxed_pct_moderna = series_complete_moderna_18plus/(100*pop2019), vaxed_pct_jans = series_complete_janssen_18plus/(100*pop2019), vaxed_pct_pfizer = series_complete_pfizer_18plus/(100*pop2019)) ## Filtering to day df_day = df %&gt;% filter(submission_date == &quot;10/1/2021&quot;) ## Running Model ols.4 &lt;- lm(deaths_pc ~ vaxed_pct_jans + vaxed_pct_moderna + vaxed_pct_pfizer, data = df_day) summary(ols.4) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = deaths_pc ~ vaxed_pct_jans + vaxed_pct_moderna + ## vaxed_pct_pfizer, data = df_day) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.93880 -0.29403 -0.05261 0.15284 2.13378 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

There is a high degree of correlation between the rates each vaccine were administered which is contributing to the large standard errors. The p-value of the \\(F\\)-statistic tells us the probability that we would see a result this extreme given all of the coefficients on the vaccines are actually zero, reinforcing our findings above. This is not necessary for this lab, but to assess the efficacy of one vaccine over another, we could conduct an \\(F\\) test. Remember, the formula for F-tests is: \\[F_{q, N-k} = \\frac{(R^2_{Unrestricted}-R^2_{Restricted})\\setminus q}{(1-R^2_{Unrestricted}) \\setminus (N-k)}\\] As an example, I will evaluate if \\(\\beta_1 = \\beta_2\\) in the following model: \\(deaths_pc_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1jans_{it} + \\beta_2moderna_{it} + \\beta_3pfizer_{it} + \\epsilon_i\\) which is ols.4 estimated above that examines the relationship between the rate of vaccination for each vaccine and deaths per capita in state \\(i\\) and day \\(t\\). We can do this manually, but library(car) makes it easy. See the code below: ## F Test linearHypothesis(ols.4, c(&quot;vaxed_pct_jans = vaxed_pct_moderna&quot;)) ## Linear hypothesis test ## ## Hypothesis: ## vaxed_pct_jans - vaxed_pct_moderna = 0 ## ## Model 1: restricted model ## Model 2: deaths_pc ~ vaxed_pct_jans + vaxed_pct_moderna + vaxed_pct_pfizer ## ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) ## 1 48 14.451 ## 2 47 14.445 1 0.0056829 0.0185 0.8924 We can see that the \\(p\\)-value is not statistically significant, meaning that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that \\(\\beta_1\\) is statistically significantly different than \\(\\beta_2\\).
