## Purpose of This Site

The goal of this site is to have a place where you can look for examples of code. Think of this site as a log of all of the topics we cover in class and in lab sessions. I will make updates throughout the semester as we cover more advanced material. I hope this proves to be a helpful and beneficial resource and offer an easier to access format than the Google Doc. 

Let me know if any of this code doesn’t run correctly or if you have any questions or issues!

## Join the data sets.
- Join the cases and vaccination data by date and state.
    - Case data: [United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv](# https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36)

    - Vaccination data: [COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc)

    - Other state variables: USstates.xlsx

- Add the USstates.xlsx data and limit your dataframe to the states listed in USstates.xlsx.  
- How do you know if your merge was successful?


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Loading Case Data
case <- read_csv("Data/United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv")

## Loading Vax Data 
vax <- read_csv("Data/COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv")

## Joining Case & Vax
case_vax <- case %>%
  left_join(vax, by = c("submission_date" = "Date", "state" = "Location"))

## Adding in state variables
states <- read_excel("Data/USstates.xlsx")

## Joining all datasets to create df
df <- case_vax %>%
  filter(state %in% states$stateAbbr) %>%
  left_join(states, by = c("state" = "stateAbbr")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() ## making variable names lowercase with underscores

## Checking for only states
count(tibble(unique(df$state)))

## View(df)

```


## Create and add the following variables to your dataframe density, deaths per capita, cases per capita and vaccinated percent.

- For a specific day, show the top five states ranked by deaths per capita and calculate the average vaccinated per capita and the mean, minimum and maximum deaths per capita.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Creating Variables
df <- df %>% 
  mutate("deaths_pc" = 100000*new_death/pop2019, 
         "cases_pc"  = 100000*new_case/pop2019,
         "vaxed_pct"  = series_complete_12plus_pop_pct/100,
         "density"   = pop2019/(1000000*sq_miles))

## Filtering to specific day
df_day <- df %>%
  filter(submission_date == "10/1/2021")

## Top five states by deaths per capita
df_day %>%
  arrange(desc(deaths_pc)) %>%
  dplyr::select(submission_date, state, deaths_pc, cases_pc, vaxed_pct, density) %>%
  slice(1:5)

## Mean vaxed per capita and mean, min, max of deaths per capita
df_day %>%
  summarise(mean_vaxed = mean(vaxed_pct),
            mean_deaths = mean(deaths_pc),
            min_deaths = min(deaths_pc),
            max_deaths = max(deaths_pc))

```

## Estimate three regression models with deaths per capita on your selected day as the dependent variable.
- Your first model will have only Trump 2020 percent as an independent variable.
- Your second model will add vaccinated percent as an independent variable.
- Your third model will add density.
- Before you estimate the models, write down your expectations about what will happen in these models.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Trump percent model
ols.1 <- lm(deaths_pc ~ trump2020_percent, data = df_day)
summary(ols.1)

## Trump and Vax model
ols.2 <- lm(deaths_pc ~ trump2020_percent + vaxed_pct, data = df_day)
summary(ols.2)

## Trump, Vax, and Density Model
ols.3 <- lm(deaths_pc ~ trump2020_percent + vaxed_pct + density, data = df_day)
summary(ols.3)
```

The results of `ols.1`, using October 1st, 2021 as the day, indicate that area with higher support for Donald Trump have more deaths per capita, specifically, a one percentage increase in Trump's 2020 vote share, on average, increases deaths per capita by 1.6. This is a classic case of omitted variable bias, however. Once we control for the percent vaxed in an area, the `trump2020_percent` loses statistical significance. We can see in the second model that the coefficient on the Trump vote share variable greatly decreases and is no longer statistically significant at conventional thresholds. `vaxed_pct` is statistically significant at the $p<.05$ level and indicates that a one percent increase in an areas vaccination rate corresponds, on average, with a 1.9 decrease in deaths per capita, holding `trump2020_percent` constant. This result stands even when controlling for an areas density as shown in model 3.

## Assess specific vaccines
- Create and add vaccinated percent by state for each of the Pfizer, Modern and Janssen (which is Johnson and Johnson) vaccines.
- Use _pop2019_ for population
- Use Series\_Complete\_Moderna\_18Plus, Series\_Complete\_Janssen\_18Plus and Series\_Complete\_Pfizer\_18Plus for the vaccination totals.

- Estimate a model in which deaths per capita is a function of all three vaccination rates.

- Explain what the results mean, especially in light of the results above for overall vaccination results.

- Explain how one would compare the efficacy of the individual vaccines (e.g., whether the Moderna vaccine works better than the Johnson and Johnson vaccine). Many answers would work here.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Creating vaxed percent variables for different vaccines
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(vaxed_pct_moderna  = series_complete_moderna_18plus/(100*pop2019),
         vaxed_pct_jans  = series_complete_janssen_18plus/(100*pop2019),
         vaxed_pct_pfizer  = series_complete_pfizer_18plus/(100*pop2019))

## Filtering to day
df_day = df %>% 
  filter(submission_date == "10/1/2021")

## Running Model
ols.4 <- lm(deaths_pc ~ vaxed_pct_jans + vaxed_pct_moderna +
             vaxed_pct_pfizer, data = df_day)
summary(ols.4)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', collapse = TRUE}
## Outputting Final Model
stargazer(ols.1, ols.2, ols.3, ols.4,
          keep.stat = c("n","ser", "rsq", "f"),
          report = "vcst", header = FALSE, type="html",
          column.labels = c("Model 1", "Model 2", "Model 3", "Model 4"),
          digits = 3, title = "Lab I OLS Results",
          dep.var.caption = "", dep.var.labels.include = FALSE)
```

The results are no longer statistically significance due to multicollinearity. There is a high degree of correlation between the rates each vaccine were administered which is contributing to the large standard errors. The p-value of the $F$-statistic tells us the probability that we would see a result this extreme given all of the coefficients on the vaccines are actually zero, reinforcing our findings above. 

This is not necessary for this lab, but to assess the efficacy of one vaccine over another, we could conduct an $F$ test. Remember, the formula for F-tests is: $$F_{q, N-k} = \frac{(R^2_{Unrestricted}-R^2_{Restricted})\setminus q}{(1-R^2_{Unrestricted}) \setminus (N-k)}$$

As an example, I will evaluate if $\beta_1 = \beta_2$ in the following model: $deaths_pc_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1jans_{it} + \beta_2moderna_{it} + \beta_3pfizer_{it} + \epsilon_i$ which is `ols.4` estimated above that examines the relationship between the rate of vaccination for each vaccine and deaths per capita in state $i$ and day $t$. We can do this manually, but `library(car)` makes it easy. See the code below:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## F Test 
linearHypothesis(ols.4, c("vaxed_pct_jans = vaxed_pct_moderna"))
```

We can see that the $p$-value is not statistically significant, meaning that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that $\beta_1$ is statistically significantly different than $\beta_2$.

## Optional Lab 1b

This lab is optional and just for some additional practice.

### Load the World Values Survey data from "Data/WV7_small.csv" and the CountryCode data from "Data/Country codes for WVS wave 7.csv".
The codebook for the World Values Survey data is available at 
http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp

The variables in WV_small were created as follows:

- Satisfaction with your life from 1 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied) (*V23*)
- Income: a country-specific scale ranging from 1 (lowest income category) to 10 (highest income category) (*V239* in the dataset)
- Education: a scale ranging from 1 (no formal education) to 9 (a degree from a university) (*V248* in the dataset)
- Country: based on *V2* in the dataset.  See “Country codes for WVS wave 6.csv”
- Conservatism: self-identified political conservatism from 1 (most liberal) to 10 (most conservative) (*V95* in the data set)
- Male: a dummy variable indicating male (*V240*)
- Religious: Indicating how often the individual attends religious services ranging from 1 (almost never) to 7 (more than once a week) (this is a re-coding of *V145* that had the polarity reversed, but is harder to interpret)
- Marital: Marital status 1 = Married 2 = Living together as married 3 = Divorced 4 = Separated 5 = Widowed 6 = Single
- Survey year: year survey taken
- Birth year: respondent's year of birth

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## World Values Dataset
wv <- read_csv("Data/WV7_small.csv")

## Country Codes
cc <- read_csv("Data/Country codes for WVS wave 7.csv")
```


### Join the country name from the CountryCode data to the World Values data.  The country code is *V2* in CountryCode and *B_Country* in the World Values data.  Create two data objects of the countries in and not in the World Values data. Display the first 10 countries for each list.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Left Join
wv <- wv %>%
  left_join(cc, by = c("B_COUNTRY" = "V2"))

## Showing countries in
countries_in_wv <- tibble(unique(wv$country))
countries_in_wv[1:10,]

## Anti Join
countries_out <- cc %>%
  anti_join(wv, by = c("V2" = "B_COUNTRY")) %>%
  filter(V2 > 0)

## Countries not in wv
countries_out %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

### Using pipes, calculate the percent immigrant in every country. Show the highest 10 and lowest 10 countries. (Be sure to think through what the variable in the data set means.) 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Recoding Immigrant Variable
wv$Immigrant <- wv$Immigrant-1

## 10 Highest
wv %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(pct_imm = mean(Immigrant, na.rm=T), n=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(pct_imm)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

## 10 Lowest
## Percent immigrant in each country
wv %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(pct_imm = mean(Immigrant, na.rm=T), n=n())%>%
  arrange(pct_imm) %>%
  slice(1:10)

```


### We're now going to give some examples of the kind of data we can calculate.  Think about how you would do this in Excel (but don't actually do it!) and then calculate in R. Calculate the percent of immigrants who are men, by country and show the highest and lowest 10 countries.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## 10 Highest
wv %>%
  filter(Male==1) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(pct_imm = mean(Immigrant, na.rm=T), n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_imm)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

## 10 Lowest
wv %>%
  filter(Male==1) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(pct_imm = mean(Immigrant, na.rm=T), n=n()) %>%
  arrange(pct_imm) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```


### Group by marital status and country and show the percent of people in each category who are men.  Show the results for a country of your choice and briefly discuss what it means when the percentages in each category are not roughly 50 percent. Recall that the coding for the *Marital* variable is 1 = Married 2 = Living together as married 3 = Divorced 4 = Separated 5 = Widowed 6 = Single.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wv %>%
  group_by(country, Marital) %>%
  summarize(male_pct = mean(Male, na.rm=T), n=n()) %>%
  filter(country == "United States")

```


### Come up with your own alternatives: think about some possible subset of people and some information we have about them and see if you can write code to capture that information.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wv %>%
  group_by(country, Income) %>%
  summarize(imm_pct = mean(Immigrant, na.rm=T), n=n()) %>%
  filter(country == "United States")

```
