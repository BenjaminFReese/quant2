## Purpose of This Site

The goal of this site is to have a place where you can look for examples of code. Data analysis is a collaborative process where we all should be actively learning from each other. Think of this document as a log of all of the topics we cover in class and in lab sessions. I will make updates throughout the semester as we cover more advanced material. I hope this proves to be a helpful and beneficial resource, but this document is no substitute for rigorous study of causal inference and R programming. 

Let me know if any of this code doesnâ€™t run correctly or if you have any questions or issues!
